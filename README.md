[7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] 

Firstly; we determine a root and if other numbers are greater than root, write right side. If other numbers are smaller than root, write left side. 


                      Root = 7
                         
                         7
                      /     \
                     5       8
                   /  \        \
                  1    6         9
                /   \
               0     3
                    / \
                   2   4
